# Summary

Energy flows through societal energy conversion chains (ECCs)
enable economic activity and facilitate human flourishing.
To understand economic growth and human well-being, 
the field of energy analysis evaluates ECCs
from the primary stage 
(coal, oil, natural gas) 
to the final stage
(energy purchased by consumers, such as refined petroleum and electricity),
to the useful stage
(heat, mechanical drive, and light),
and sometimes to energy services
(transport, thermal comfort, and illumination).
Societal exergy analysis (SEA), an extension of energy analysis,
quantifies ECCs as exergy, 
the mechanical work potential of energy.


# Statement of need

Historically, SEA has analyzed the ECCs of individual countries
using a large number of linked spreadsheets, 
with data in varying and inconsistent formats 
[@Ayres:2003ec; @Serrenho:2014aa; @Brockway:2014aa; @Brockway:2015aa].
The authors of this paper and others in the field
wanted to expand SEA to cover all countries, but
the spreadsheet approach to data analysis was
deemed not scalable.
We created a suite of `R` packages to provide scalable SEA 
for every country in the world.
This paper describes the design of those packages and
demonstrates briefly their use.


# Design of `R` packages

Several decisions influenced the design and APIs for the packages.
The decision involves data format. 
We selected the Physical Supply-Use Table (PSUT) framework,
a matrix approach to describing energy flows from 
extraction to
processing stages and, ultimately, 
to final demand [@Rocco:2016; @Guevara:2017; @Heun:2018].
The PSUT framework succinctly describes the flow of energy carriers
(products in PSUT terminology) 
among energy conversion machines 
(industries in PSUT terminology)
in a set of four matrices as described in the following table.

| Matrix | rows x columns     | Name            | Description                                              |
|:-------|:-------------------|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **R**  | industry x product | Resource matrix | Contains exogeneous energy inputs to an ECC              |
| **U**  | product x industry | Use matrix      | Describes how each energy conversion device uses energy  |
| **V**  | industry x product | Make matrix     | Describes how each energy conversion device makes energy |
| **Y**  | product x industry | Final demand matrix | Describes how each energy carrier is consumed        |

energy flows through various 
The matrix approach to data storage brings the challenge that 
different countries, 
and different years for a given country,
have varying energy products and varying energy processing machines.

Given the decision to use PSUT matrices to store ECC data,
packages were created to enable manipulation of matrices
within the tidyverse, as shown in the following table.




| Package | Function |
|---------|----------|
| [RCLabels](https://matthewheun.github.io/RCLabels/)      | Manipulate row and column matrices |
| [matsbyname](https://matthewheun.github.io/matsbyname/)  | Perform matrix mathematics that respects row and column names |



It would be convenient to perform matrix mathematics in `R` data frames
as easily as scalar mathematics in data frames. 


with the `dplyr` package from the `tidyverse`.
To do that, a way to embed matrices in a cell of a data frame is required.

Further, a means of manipulating row and column names 





One problem is da

that 

To solve these problems and 
to meet the need for the SEA community,
we developed a suite of `R` packages. 





to enable 
analyses for all countries, as described in the following table.

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat{f}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:

![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:

![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
